WRIT  Programming Languages -Version :1
========================================



How  WRIT P.L and  framework  are   invented? How  many  years  took  place?  Who  invented  it?
==============================================================================================

All WRIT Programming  Languages  are  invented   by  wilmix  jemin  j  has more  experience  

in  JAVA/J2ee, C/C++  ,  and  Dotnet Programming  Languages.



A) CDollar Programming Language
===============================

CDollar  Project  took  many years  from  year  2004  to 2015  to   invent  CDollar language in  C/C++

and  later the  source code is  modified   in  JAVA  and  C#  Language  and  it's  functionalities  are

built  easily.

CDollar  published  in Google  code is   VERSION 1 

and  it  will  work  only  in  windows.


Advantages:
==========

Great  expert   to  design  any   Datastructures.

It  is also used  for  OS  Design.

It  is  used  to contruct Form,bills  ,Reports. 

Mostly  based  on  Java oops,  C/C++ OOPS, C#  Opps  ,  and  Advanced  OOps  concepts.
