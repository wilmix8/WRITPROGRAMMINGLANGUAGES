===========================

WRIT  Programming Languages -Version :1
========================================

ALL  WRIT  P.L   is invented   by wilmix jemin j  

he has 9+ Years  exp  in IT field.

and  has  Experience  in various  technologies  like java ,C/c++, Dotnet.



How  WRIT P.L and  framework  are   invented? How  many  years  took  place?
===============================================================================



A) CDollar Programming Language
===============================

CDollar  Project  took  many years  from  year  2004  to 2015  to   invent  CDollar language in  C/C++

and  later the  source code is  modified   in  JAVA  and  C#  Language  and  it's  functionalities  are

built  easily.

CDollar  published  in Google  code is   VERSION 1 

and  it  will  work  only  in  windows.


Advantages:
==========

Great  expert   to  design  any   Datastructures.

It  is also used  for  OS  Design.

It  is  used  to contruct Form,bills  ,Reports. 

Mostly  based  on  Java oops,  C/C++ OOPS, C#  Opps  ,  and  Advanced  OOps  concepts.  



B) GDollar  programming Language
===================================


GDollar  Project  took  many years  from  year  2006  to 2015  to   invent GDollar language in  CDollar

and  later the  source code is  modified   in    C#  Language  and  it's  functionalities  are

built  easily.

So  C#  is  the  Parent  language  for  GDollar. 

GDollar  published  in Google  code is   VERSION 1 and  more   brief  about  GDollar is  available  in  Github tutorials

and  it  will  work  only  in  windows.



Advantages
===========

Great  expert   to  design  any   Datastructures.

It  is also used  for  Complier  Design.

It  is  used  to construct Form,bills  ,Reports. 

Mostly  based  on  Java oops,  C/C++ OOPS, C#  Opps  ,  and  Advanced  OOps  concepts.  


C) CHDOLLAR  Programming  Language

CH stands for GAMMA and dollar stands for money.


So we called as GAMMA language. 


Merits of CH$
==============

> It is Good to create any compilers..and Advanced Operating systems and utilities.
> It has simpilified code
> it uses Pointers concept.
> CH$ also used with C@ and Arrow# in mobile and cloud computing when  deployed  in  cloud servers.
